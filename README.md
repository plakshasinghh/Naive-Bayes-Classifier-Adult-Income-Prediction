# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Adult-Income-Prediction

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a person earns >50K or ≤50K per year using the Adult Income Dataset (adult.csv).
The model uses demographic and employment attributes to learn probabilistic patterns and classify income categories.

 Dataset: adult.csv
